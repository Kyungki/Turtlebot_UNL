## OpenCV with ROS using Python
Using OpenCV with ROS is possible using the CvBridge library.  
This tutorial will show you how to get a message from an Image topic in ROS, convert it to an OpenCV Image, and manipulate the image.  

## Prequisites
This example requires an image stream on the `/camera/rgb/image_raw` topic.  
1. On the _turtlebot_, run 3dsensor.launch:
    1. `roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch`
    
This section **recommends** that the *catkin_ws* to be initialized.

## Getting an Image from a ROS Topic using Python
The following example code can be used on __either__ the _master_ or _turtlebot_ computers.  
1. Create a new Python file in your scripts folder in your workspace:
    1. `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts`
    2. `gedit ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
2. Start the script by specifying which Python version to use:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2.7

# Print "Hello!" to terminal
print "Hello!"
```
  * Test the script in your terminal:
      * `python ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
3. Import the neccesary ROS and Computer Vision libraries and Initialize the ROS Node
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2.7
# Import ROS libraries and messages
import rospy

# Print "Hello!" to terminal
print "Hello!"

# Initialize the ROS Node named 'opencv_example', allow multiple nodes to be run with this name
rospy.init_node('opencv_example', anonymous=True)

# Print "Hello ROS!" to the Terminal and ROSLOG
rospy.loginfo("Hello ROS!")
```
  * Test the script in your terminal:
      * `python ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
5. Create a subscriber for an Image topic, and define a callback function  
   Use _CTRL+C_ to stop the program
```python
...

import rospy
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image

...

# Define a callback for the Image message
def image_callback(img_msg):
    # log some info about the image topic
    rospy.loginfo(img_msg.header)

# Initalize a subscriber to the "/camera/rgb/image_raw" topic with the function "image_callback" as a callback
sub_image = rospy.Subscriber("/camera/rgb/image_raw", Image, image_callback)

# Loop to keep the program from shutting down unless ROS is shut down, or CTRL+C is pressed
while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    rospy.spin()
```
  * Test the script in your terminal:
      * `python ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
6. Import OpenCV and cv_bridge, create a window to show a live image in  
   Use _CTRL+C_ in the terminal to stop the program
```python
...
# Import ROS libraries and messages
...

# Import OpenCV libraries and tools
import cv2
from cv_bridge import CvBridge, CvBridgeError

...

# Print "Hello ROS!" to the Terminal and to a ROS Log file located in ~/.ros/log/loghash/*.log
rospy.loginfo("Hello ROS!")

# Initialize the CvBridge class
bridge = CvBridge()

# Define a function to show the image in an OpenCV Window
def show_image(img):
    cv2.imshow("Image Window", img)
    cv2.waitKey(3)

# Define a callback for the Image message
def image_callback(img_msg):
    # log some info about the image topic
    rospy.loginfo(img_msg.header)

    # Try to convert the ROS Image message to a CV2 Image
    try:
        cv_image = bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(img_msg, "passthrough")
    except CvBridgeError, e:
        rospy.logerr("CvBridge Error: {0}".format(e))

    # Show the converted image
    show_image(cv_image)

# Initalize a subscriber to the "/camera/rgb/image_raw" topic with the function "image_callback" as a callback
sub_image = rospy.Subscriber("/camera/rgb/image_raw", Image, image_callback)

# Initialize an OpenCV Window named "Image Window"
cv2.namedWindow("Image Window", 1)

# Loop to keep the program from shutting down unless ROS is shut down, or CTRL+C is pressed
while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    rospy.spin()
```
  * Test the script in your terminal:
      * `python ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
7. Rotate the image 90 degrees  
   Use _CTRL+C_ in the terminal to stop the program
```python
...
# Define a callback for the Image message
define image_callback(img_msg):
    ...

    # Flip the image 90deg
    cv_image = cv2.transpose(cv_image)
    cv_image = cv2.flip(cv_image,1)

    # Show the converted image
    show_image(cv_image)

...
```
  * Test the script in your terminal:
      * `python ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
8. Allow execution permissions for your code, and use rosrun to run it!  
   In a new terminal:
    1. `chmod +x ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_houston/scripts/opencv_example_1.py`
    2. `source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh`
    3. `rosrun turtlebot_houston opencv_example_1.py`
