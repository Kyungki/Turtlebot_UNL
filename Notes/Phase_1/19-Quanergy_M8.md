## Quanergy M8
The M8 is the first cost-effective long range LiDAR sensor enabling ubiquitous use of smart sensing in dynamic situations— made and tested for 3D mapping, security, harsh industrial environments and the most demanding applications. The M8 sensor’s small design sees by day or night, with no IR signature needed, and works in any weather. Multiple laser beams and Time-of-Flight (TOF) depth perception result in 3D point clouds for spatial sensing. With a 360° field of view, 420,000 points per second, long measurement range, high accuracy, and fine resolution, this sensor is now available at a breakthrough price.

## Prequisites
This section **requires** the *catkin_ws* to be initialized and the *turtlebot_houston* package created.

1. Mount the lidar on top of the Turtlebot:
    ![](Resources/19-screw_mounting.jpg)  
2. Install the boost converter (power adatper)  
    - The Red/Black cable pair is 12vDC (from Kobuki)
    - The Yellow/Black cable pair is 24vDC (to Lidar)

### Install the Quangery libraries
**This step is handled in the automated setup**  
1. `cp -r ~/turtlebot_houston/Setup/workspace/quanergy_client ~/workspace`  
2. `cd ~/workspace/quanergy_client`  
3. `mkdir build`  
4. `cd build`  
5. `cmake ..`  
6. `sudo make install`  

### Install the Quanergy catkin package
**This step is handled in the automated setup**
1. `cp -r ~/turtlebot_houston/Setup/catkin_ws/src/quanergy_client_ros ~/catkin_ws/src`
2. `cd ~/catkin_ws`
3. `catkin_make`

## Launch
Launching the driver only:  
- `roslaunch turtlebot_houston quanergy.launch`  

Launching the laser_scan converter:  
- `roslaunch turtlebot_houston quanergy_lidarscan.launch  

Launching the driver with visualization:  
- `roslaunch turtlebot_houston quanergy_test.launch`
