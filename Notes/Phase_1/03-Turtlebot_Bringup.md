## Turtlebot Bringup
The Turtlebot Bringup package contains all the neccesary configuration and launch files for loading the Turtlebot drivers.

The minimal.launch file starts up the Kobuki base drivers and the basic Turtlebot configuration settings for ROS.  
1. Load the minimal.launch file
    1. On the Turtlebot computer, open a new terminal and type:
```bash
 roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
 ```
You should hear a chime from the Kobuki once ROS has connected to it.

## Orbbec Astra Bringup
You can bring up the Orbbec Astra drivers by using the 3d_sensor launch file located in the turtlebot_bringup package
1. Load the 3dsensor.launch file
    1. On the Turtlebot computer, open a new terminal and type:
```bash
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
```

## Seeing Orbbec Astra data
You can view data from the Orbbec Astra using the rqt_image_view program.
1. On the master computer, open a new terminal and type:
```bash
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw
```

## Testing Kobuki
1. Launch the GUI to check out the Kobuki status
    1. From the master computer, open a new terminal and type:
